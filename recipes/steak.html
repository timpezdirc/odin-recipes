    <h3>Lean cut of beef that comes from the cow's lower abdominal muscles</h3>

    <p>Flank steak is a lean cut of beef that comes from the cow's lower abdominal muscles. It's a relatively tough cut that's low in fat, which means a few things: Flank steak doesn't need to be trimmed, it's inexpensive compared to other cuts, and it benefits greatly from marination.</p>
    <p>Flank and skirt steaks are similar in a lot of ways, but they do have notable differences. Skirt steak comes from the diaphragm of the cow, while flank steak comes from the lower abdomen. Also, skirt steak is fattier and has more marbling than flank steak. Flank steak is thicker and wider.</p>
